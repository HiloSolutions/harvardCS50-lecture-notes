# Memory
**Integer:** normally takes 4 bytes.

**String:** length + 1 to include \0.
## Hexadecimal (base 16):
## Addresses
& before a variable will give us back the address.

*(dereference operator) will take us there.

## Pointer Arithmetic
Harder to grasp than many other concepts.

Variable that contains an address of some value (aka. address in memory)

```
int n = 50; //print a variable
int *p = &n; //pointer (int address) of variable

```

## Comparing Strings
computer stores memory of first character.
## Copying
## Valgrind
## Garbage Values
## Swap
## Overflow
## Scanf


# Segmentation Faults
You go to memory that is too far away and touch another segment of memory that is not allocated to you.
Hakers can inject code into a c program and search memory.

# Dynamic Memory Allocation
Dynamic memory allocation is the process of assigning the memory space during the execution time or the run time.
# Stack
# Heap
# Buffer
# Overflow
# File I/O
# Images
