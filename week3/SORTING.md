# Selection Sort
Select smallest (or largest) element again and again and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part.

Pseudocode
```
For i from 0 to n-1
  Find smallest number between numbers[i] and numbers[n-1]
  Swap smallest number with numbers[i]
```

# Bubble Sort
the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

Pseudocode
```
Repeat n times
  For i from 0 to n-2
    If numbers[i] and numbers[i+1] out of order.
      Swap them
```


# Merge Sort
Highly efficient but uses more space

Pseudocode
```
Sort left half
Sort right half
Merge sorted halves
```
